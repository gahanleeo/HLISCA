### The place I put the md scripts according to original HLISCA 

- Finished DEA DAR and Cellchat, begin SCAVENGE

------

- compare DAR first col of chromsome region (SData7) to my result
- for DEG, Since the log2fold is kind of samill. use Ep's RDS file to test my DEG script and compare result.
- the reson is beacuse of I use `lfcShrink` that cause log2fold looks small, just use default Deseq2
